# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```

## Output
![438914675-1ddcd080-41e5-4c11-9adf-1ea55cf3d740](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f98f9807-f223-4d07-a9bd-f506dce7f265)

## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully.
